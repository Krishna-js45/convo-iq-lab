GPTIQX – AI Conversation IQ Analyzer

GPTIQX is the world’s first platform designed to measure the intelligence quotient of AI conversations. It analyzes entire chat transcripts (or live conversations) and generates three key scores:

UserIQ – Measures the quality and creativity of user prompts.

GPTIQ – Evaluates the accuracy, coherence, and depth of AI responses.

ConversationIQ – Assesses the overall synergy, flow, and engagement between user and AI.

These scores are calculated using advanced AI evaluation engines and converted into a professional IQ scale, giving users actionable insights into how well their conversations perform.
